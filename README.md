POCKETS

PROBLEM I AIM TO SOLVE:

Often we find that we spend more money on things that are unncessary and miss out buying things that will actually provide some value to our life. One of the reasons is , we think we would save up for the thing we think would add value to our value, but we cannot lock its funds easily at the snap of the fingers. We have to go through a long and tiring process of going physically to the bank and add the funds in some sort of fixed deposit or savings account.

WHAT I THINK:

I find this process tiring and not efficient.Thus, I decided to develop Bank Pockets. 

MY EFFORT TO SOLVE IT:

Bank Pockets aims to seamlessly integrate in the banking system and allow you to lock funds for particular things and would not allow you to spend the money upfront. This would allow us to control our sudden urge to buy something, knowing you have locked your funds for something of value.

WHAT VALUE IT WOULD PROVIDE:

This would help us manage our money better, as we have a complete understanding of how much exactly funds are available for leisure activities and how much is present for specific purpose, all at the avaiability of your fingertips.
It would discourage reckless spending and allow us to have a better control of our money that in turn controls our assets and decides our liabilities.
